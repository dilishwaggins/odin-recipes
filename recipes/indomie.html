    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hot dog wieners</li>
        <li>4 hot dog or sausage buns</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup sautéed onions, mushrooms and peppers</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced green olives</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley, chopped, for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><em>Steps </em></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the hot dogs: Preheat grill to 500°F. Using a pairing knife, cut small 45° slits along the length of the wieners, marking every half-inch and going about halfway deep. Transfer the wieners onto the hot grill and cook for about 5 minutes, turning occasionally to ensure they’re uniformly cooked. Use wieners in one or more of the following ways</li>
        <li>Open buns on work surface. Add a helping of pizza sauce onto each, spreading it across. Place one cooked wiener onto each bun. Sprinkle a small handful of olives on one side of hot dog. Add some of the sautéed vegetables across the other. Sprinkle with cheese. Place prepared hot dogs into an oven-safe casserole or rectangular baking pan. Transfer to preheated 250°F oven and bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese has melted and bun is toasted. Garnish with chopped parsley. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
