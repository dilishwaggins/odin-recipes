    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
    <p>
        This is a meal, well technically its breakfast but my ex-boyfriend and I took it all any time.
        I'd like to think we even bonded over it.He'd bring it to my house when i wasnt feeling good.I'd go to his house and we'd have picnics where would eat it with coke and i remember those being the happiest moments of my life. He made it for me the first time and i remember thinking
        "Hmm i'm going to marry this man".It was like i'd never eaten french toast before. Every now and then 
        i try and remake it in my own house using everything he used but i can never seem to get it right.Only
        he can make such an ordinary meal taste like a delicacy. I hope french toast makes people feel this same warmth.
